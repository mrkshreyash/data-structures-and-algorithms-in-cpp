#  Data Structures & Algorithms in C++
##  Overview
This project is a collection of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in C++. It aims to provide educational, beginner-friendly code examples of widely-used concepts like:

* Recursion (e.g., Fibonacci, Factorial, Tower of Hanoi)
* Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
* Stacks (Array-based, Linked List-based)

The project is ideal for:
* DSA learners looking to explore implementation from scratch.
* Developers preparing for technical interviews.
* Contributors interested in extending functionality or improving readability.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```
2. Compile and Run a File
Use `g++` or any C++ compiler of your choice to run individual `.cpp` files.

Example using g++:

```
g++ Fibonacci\ series.cpp -o fib
./fib
```
3. Dependencies

No external libraries required.

Standard C++ (preferably C++11 or higher).

## Usage Instructions
Each `.cpp` file is standalone and contains a `main()` function to run specific programs.

### 1. Recursion-based Algorithms

|File	|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Fibonacci series.cpp	|Calculates the Nth Fibonacci number recursively.|
|Factorial.cpp	|Calculates factorial using recursion.|
|Tower of Hanoi.cpp	|Demonstrates the Tower of Hanoi problem with recursive steps.|

### 2. Linked Lists

|File	| Description|
|-------|------------|
|Singlylinkedlist.cpp	|Implements basic operations on a singly linked list.|
|Doubled linkedlist.cpp	|Implements a doubly linked list with insert/delete at any position.|
|Circularlinkedlist.cpp	|Demonstrates circular linked list with tail-based insertion/deletion.|

### 3. Stacks

|File	                       | Description        |
|------------------------------|--------------------|
|Simplearraybasedstack.cpp	   | (Assumed) Implements stack using static arrays.|
|Dynmaic arreybased stack.cpp	| Implements stack using C++ STL vector. |
|linkedlistbasedstackk.cpp	| Implements stack using a singly linked list. |

## Contributing Guidelines
We welcome contributions! Here's how you can get involved:
