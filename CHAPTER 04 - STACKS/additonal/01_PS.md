## Checking Balancing of Symbols

<h3>Problem: How stacks can be used for checking balancing of symbols.</h3>

<hr>
<p>

Solution: <br>
Stacks can be used to check whether the given exression has balanced symbols. Each time the parser reads one character at a time. If the character is an opening pair such as `(, {, [`, then it is pushed to stack. When closing pair is accessed like `), }, ]`, then pop it.

Then compare the opening and closing pairs. If they match then the expression is balanced otherwise not.

<h3>Algorithm:</h3>

<ol type="a">
  <li>Create a stack.</li>
  <li>while (end of input is not reached)
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Read the next character.</li>
      <li>If the character is an opening symbol <code>(</code>, <code>{</code>, or <code>[</code>), push it onto the stack.</li>
      <li>If the character is a closing symbol <code>)</code>, <code>}</code>, or <code>]</code>:
        <ul>
          <li>If the stack is empty, report unbalanced and stop.</li>
          <li>Pop the top of the stack and check if it matches the current closing symbol.</li>
          <li>If it doesn't match, report unbalanced and stop.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>After reading all characters:
    <ul>
      <li>If the stack is empty, report balanced.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, report unbalanced.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Example</th>
    <th>Valid?</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>(({{[]}}))</code></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>All symbols are correctly nested and matched.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>({[)]}</code></td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>Mismatched closing symbol – wrong order.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>({[]</code></td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>Missing closing symbols – unbalanced.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
